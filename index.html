      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        Madison Chazo is a 24-year-old hobby developer living in Richmond,
        Virginia. She started learning to code while at Cornell University,
        where she studied biology before dropping out to pursue other things.
        She is currently enrolled in the University of Richmond's coding boot
        camp, where she is learning web development. Her current goal is to
        eventually get a job as a programmer or developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of coding, Madison enjoys making art, playing video games,
        watching anime, and playing tabletop roleplaying games, among other
        nerdy pursuits. She loves games and shows that combine fun mechanics
        with meaningful storytelling. Some of her favorites include Baldur's
        Gate, Mass Effect, Hollow Knight, "Steins;Gate," "Attack on Titan," and
        "Castlevania." Her dream is to participate in the process of making a
        video game.
